    <h2>WHY PHYSICAL BOOK IS BETTER THAN E-BOOK</h2>

    <p>
       
        Reading physical books provides a unique and tangible experience that electronic books cannot replicate. 
        The feeling of holding a book in your hands, flipping through its pages, and feeling the paper material creates a deeper reading experience. 
        Additionally, reading physical books does not subject us to distractions like social media notifications or website advertisements that can disrupt our focus when reading e-books. 
        This helps readers fully immerse themselves in the content of the book, leading to better understanding and retention of the material. 
        Furthermore, physical books do not require batteries or an internet connection, making them easy to carry when traveling or in places with limited internet access. 
        In conclusion, the physical nature and complete focus make physical books the preferred choice for most book lovers.
